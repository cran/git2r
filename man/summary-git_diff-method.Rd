\examples{
\dontrun{
## Initialize a repository
path <- tempfile(pattern="git2r-")
dir.create(path)
repo <- init(path)

## Config user
config(repo, user.name="Alice", user.email="alice@example.org")

## Create a file, add, commit
writeLines("Hello world!", file.path(path, "test.txt"))
add(repo, "test.txt")
commit(repo, "Commit message")

## Change the file
writeLines(c("Hello again!", "Here is a second line", "And a third"),
           file.path(path, "test.txt"))

## diff between index and workdir
diff_1 <- diff(repo)
summary(diff_1)

## Diff between index and HEAD is empty
diff_2 <- diff(repo, index=TRUE)
summary(diff_2)

## Diff between tree and working dir, same as diff_1
diff_3 <- diff(tree(commits(repo)[[1]]))
summary(diff_3)

## Add changes, diff between index and HEAD is the same as diff_1
add(repo, "test.txt")
diff_4 <- diff(repo, index=TRUE)
summary(diff_4)

## Diff between tree and index
diff_5 <- diff(tree(commits(repo)[[1]]), index=TRUE)
summary(diff_5)

## Diff between two trees
commit(repo, "Second commit")
tree_1 <- tree(commits(repo)[[2]])
tree_2 <- tree(commits(repo)[[1]])
diff_6 <- diff(tree_1, tree_2)
summary(diff_6)

## Binary files
set.seed(42)
